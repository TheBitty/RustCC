# RustCC Project Specification

## 1. Specification

### Goal
Build a full C compiler in Rust (RustCC) with a primary focus on code obfuscation that transforms standard C code into functionally-equivalent versions resistant to reverse engineering. This project is intended for educational and research purposes, particularly to understand compiler design and security techniques.

### Core Requirements
- Implement a complete C compiler pipeline in Rust:
  - Parse C source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST)
  - Apply configurable obfuscation transformations to the AST
  - Perform standard compiler optimizations
  - Generate machine code directly or through LLVM
- Support both direct compilation and transformation of existing C code
- Provide a command-line interface for configuration
- Support cross-platform operation (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Process the latest C language features (C17/C18 standard)

### Key Features
- String encryption: Transform string literals into encrypted data with runtime decryption
- Control flow flattening: Restructure logical flow to confuse analysis
- API call hiding: Replace direct API calls with dynamic resolution
- Multiple obfuscation levels (0-3) for easy configuration
- Configurable output (source or compiled binary)

## 2. Rules

### Technical Constraints
- Implement in Rust programming language
- Consider LLVM integration for the backend compiler phases
- Keep dependencies minimal and well-maintained
- Support the latest C language standard (C17/C18) with compatibility for older code
- Maintain functional equivalence between original and obfuscated code
- Create modular architecture with clear separation between compiler phases
- Support both standalone compilation and transformation workflows
- Implementation details for specific transformations will be developed iteratively during the research phase

### Design Principles
- Prioritize reliability over complexity
- Focus on security research use cases
- Maintain clear separation between parsing, transformation, and code generation
- Design transformations to be composable and configurable
- Use error handling that provides useful feedback

### Development Rules
- Follow Rust best practices and idioms
- Write unit tests for each component
- Document public API and key internal components
- Use meaningful commit messages and organized pull requests
- Keep security considerations paramount in all design decisions
- Document research findings and design decisions to support the educational purpose
- Include detailed comments explaining compiler theory concepts in the code

## 3. Oversight

### Success Criteria
- Successfully compile standard C programs from source to executable
- Successfully parse, transform, and recompile existing C code
- Support all major features of the C17/C18 standard
- Transformed programs maintain the same functionality as originals
- Obfuscated code is measurably more difficult to reverse engineer
- Compiler performance is comparable to other modern C compilers
- Command-line interface is intuitive and well-documented
- Project is cross-platform compatible
- Code base is maintainable and extensible

### Milestones
1. **Research Phase**: Study compiler design, obfuscation techniques, and explore potential implementation approaches
2. **Basic Infrastructure**: Project setup, CLI framework, C17/C18 parser implementation
3. **Frontend Compiler**: Complete AST generation and semantic analysis
4. **Core Transformations**: Design and implement obfuscation techniques (string encryption, control flow flattening, API hiding)
5. **Optimization Phase**: Implement standard compiler optimizations
6. **Backend Generation**: Implement code generation (either directly or via LLVM)
7. **Integration**: Finalize complete compiler pipeline and transformation workflows
8. **Refinement & Documentation**: Performance optimization, comprehensive documentation with educational materials

### Monitoring Metrics
- Test coverage for critical components
- Performance benchmarks for parsing and transformation
- Size and complexity metrics of generated code
- Successful compilation rate for transformed code
- Documentation quality and educational value
- Personal learning outcomes and research findings

### Review Process
- Self-review of code quality and implementation approach
- Testing with diverse C codebases to ensure compatibility
- Research summary after each major milestone
- Documentation review for educational value and clarity
- Reflection on learning outcomes and potential research publication opportunities

This specification serves as the foundation for the RustCC project and may evolve as development progresses and new insights emerge. As a solo educational and research project, flexibility in implementation approaches is expected, with a focus on learning compiler design principles and security techniques through practical implementation.
